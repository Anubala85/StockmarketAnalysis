# STOCKMARKET ANALYSIS #

## Introduction ##

This project is to analyze market data.

## Approach ##

**PART A:

In in this section have assigned variables to check for the total number of worksheets in a workbook and to execute the code across the sheets.

Looping Statement used:
*I have used a FOR loop to makesure the loop executes across the total number of worksheets in this workbook.

**PART B

In this section I have calculated values of Ticker,yearly change, percentage change and total stock volume.Assigned variables for the same in the begining.

Conditional and Looping Statements used:
*Have used a FOR loop to itereate through the rows of the given data set.
*Used IF statement to generate current ticker,Starting price, and aggeraget trade volume until the current ticker change. wehn it changes we get values of close price by retriving the previous data from the current ticker therby calculating percent change.

**PART C

In this section we are calculating Greatest percenatge increase, greatest perscenatge decrease and greatest total volume.Have assigned values in the begining.

Conditinal statement used:
*Have used a IF loop to find greatest percenatge increase/decrese and greatest volume by using opertaors with the reference value that I assumed and assigned and generated the value thereby pulling its corresponding ticker and printed the output.

**PART D

In this section I have done conditinal Formatting by changing the "yearly change values" either green or red with green being positive values and red neagtive and to format percentage and this I have done this towards the end of the code (in Summary)

I have summarized my results in the summary section.
